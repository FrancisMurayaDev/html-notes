# Nesting HTML Elements

It is placing HTML elements inside one another.
- The containing element is known as the `parent element`
- The contained element is called `child element`.

```html
<a href="https://www.facebook.com">
    <h1>a heading element inside an anchor tag</h1>
</a>
```
The h1 is nested inside an anchor tag.


Placing an image inside an anchor tag:

```html
<a href="https://pixabay.com">
    <img src="images/kid.jpg" alt="a kid jumping while smiling" width="240px">
</a>
```
The image now acts as a clickable link.
