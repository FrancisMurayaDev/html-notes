# Block vs Inline Level Elements

## Block Elements

Block level elements add  a new line, and the browser usually adds some margin before and after the margin. 

They usually stretch to take the full width available(of the parent).


Example of block level elements:
- headings
- paragraphs
- lists
- div


## Inline Level Elements

They do not start a new line, they take as much width they can occupy. 

Example:
- anchor tag `<a>`
- img tag.
- span
