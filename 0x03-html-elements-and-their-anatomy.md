# HTML Elements and their anatomy

HTML tags are building blocks of html, they define structure and content of a webpage.

`non-void tags`

```html
<opening tag> Content </closing tag>
```

```html
<p>Hello World</p>

<!--This is a paragraph tag, the entire is a paragraph element-->

The entire of above is a html element.

Some tags are self closing. Also called `void tags`

```html
<tag />
```

```html
<br />

<hr />
<!-- Self closing tags -->
 ```
